## About Ismail

I am working on lasers and photonic crystals. I am learning about methods to analyze photonic crystals, such as the coupled-wave formalism. I am interested in collaborations to develop good engineering code. For this, I could use help with software issues (such as organizing code into functions) and numerical methods.

Feel free to ask about my research work in electromagnetics and photonics. You may email me at muhdikhan@gmail.com .

I am from Houston, TX and I have an interest in STEM education.
